# pcg-ricerocks
Ricerocks game from Rice University's python course, modified to use python Arcade

Original code from code skulptor: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user44_dPJ5qWvG2U_0.py

Status: Incomplete. Working on generating artwork for the new ship as the instructors specifically
requested that if we rewrite the game off of codeskulptor, we not use the spaceship.
